# Script that gets name of BAM file, centers the forward and reverse reads
# appropriately, and writes out the centered bam file.
# 
# This is an example script, meant to be copied and adjusted so it can
# work with tools/ngs/Makefile. The Makefile wants a script called
# do_center_reads that reads from stdin and writes to stdout
#
# For paired end sequencing, don't specify a shift (will be inferred from the SAM file)
#
# Note: be aware of the way the mapping was done. If e.g. the first 15 bp
# from the reads were discarded to improve the mapping, the shifting
# should not be by 73 bp, but by 73-15 = 58 bp
